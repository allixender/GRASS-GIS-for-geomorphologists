# GRASS-GIS-for-geomorphologists
Introductory guide to using the open-source GRASS GIS for drainage networks and geomorphometry, and an introduction to applications to Earth-surface dynamics.

Note to myself:

I wonder how a.Wickert's Grass open source book relates to Skyler Sorsby one's (https://www.slideshare.net/SkylerSorsby/introduction-to-geomorphology-in-grass-gis-by-skyler-sorsby)

Secondly, I might look into go through it with Grass 7.x
